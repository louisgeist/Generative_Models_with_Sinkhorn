Work completed as part of the *[Geometric data analysis](https://www.jeanfeydy.com/Teaching/index.html)* course of [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com).

Our project report is available at the repository root, see [report.pdf](https://github.com/louisgeist/Generative_Models_with_Sinkhorn/blob/main/report.pdf).

# Content
The purpose of the project was to study the article of Aude Genevay, Gabriel Peyr√©, Marco Cuturi, "Learning Generative Models with Sinkhorn Divergences" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics 2018 (AISTATS 2018).

We decided to carry out a comparative study of the previous generative models with the GAN models. We reimplemented the models, redrew some figures and proposed quantitative indicators.
